# A Day at the Beach

### Introduction

Last weekend, my friends and I decided to spend a day at the beach. _What a great idea that was!_

### The Morning Adventure

We kicked off with a **picnic breakfast** at sunrise. [The view](https://example.com/sunrise.jpg) was absolutely breathtaking.

1. We had:
   - Fresh fruit
   - Pancakes
   - Coffee

### Fun Activities

In the afternoon, we played beach volleyball, built sandcastles, and even tried surfing.

> **Note:** Surfing is _a lot_ harder than it looks!

Here's a `code snippet` for a simple beach packing list:

```python
def pack_for_beach():
  beach_bag = ["swimsuit", "towel", "sunscreen", "water"]
  return beach_bag
```
